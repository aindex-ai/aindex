Python Library for Reusable AI functions

## Functions
Functions repository:
https://github.com/aindex-ai/functions/

To submit a function submit a PR with a .json file in the folder functions. The name of the file must be unique and be the same as the "name" property in the file. This is the name that will be used to retrieve the function later. First submissions will have preference on name.
