## functions
Functions repository:
https://github.com/aindex-ai/functions/

To submit a function submit a PR with the function file in the folder functions.
The name of the file must be unique and the same as the "name" property in the file. This is the name that will be used to retrieve the function later.
First submissions have preference for new names.
